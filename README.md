This repository is for the Master Thesis in Omics Data Analysis from University of Padova
## Introduction
Tropism, defined as the tendency of a bacteria to spread in specific tissues, has therefore a determinant role in influencing natural history, severity and outcome of invasive infections by S. aureus.   However, very few is known about S. aureus differential tropism, and no specific marker is used as diagnostic and prognostic determinant of invasive and complicated S. aureus infections in clinical practice. This unmet need represents an important gap to fill, to improve prevention, diagnosis, and advancing research efforts to fight S. aureus infections. This preliminary study aims to screen for known and novel genomic determinants associated with S. aureus tropism and virulence, based on available whole genome sequences of S. aureus from public databases.
